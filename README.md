# Extreme-Learning-Machine-optimized-with-Harris-Hawk-Algorithm

Using Harris Hawk Optimization Algorithm to optimize the weights in an Extreme Learning Machine

The HHO algorithm is motivated by different attack strategies of hawks exploring and attacking their prey. 

HHO is a population-based optimization technology that consists of three stages: exploration, the transformation of exploration, and exploitation.
